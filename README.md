# myGameEngine:   Predator
i was making some opengl projects to cope with repetition of code i m making somewhat gameEngine<br>

this game engine is supposed to make small games loading model<br>
i m learning opengl and other concepts hoping to implement them<br>
it is not still that much advanced to be called a game engine but i m working on it<br>

model can be loaded and variable can be varied with imgui<br>

instancing and adding other texture is also made easier for user
